# 911-Calls-Data-Capstone-Project

In this project, I used some data analytics tools such as numpy and pandas to analyze 911 calls from Kaggle. 
Additionally, added some features such as column for the - 'most common reason for 911 calls' from the dataset. 
Did some data visualization using seaborn and created heatmaps.
